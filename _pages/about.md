I’m a computational social scientist with broad interests in social behavior, digital media effects, human-AI interactions, and well-being.
I am a research staff in Media and Personality Lab [subreddit](https://maplab.stanford.edu/) at the Stanford University, working with Gabriella M. Harari [subreddit](https://maplab.stanford.edu/people/gabriella-harari). I'm also Visiting Scholor at GUII lab [subreddit](https://guiilab.ucsc.edu/home) and Lecturer in Computational Media department at University of California, Santa Cruz. 
I received my PhD degree in Computer Science from University of Colorado Boulder. 


I have two complementary lines of research focused on (1) Understanding and analysing the effects of social interactions on people’s psychological experiences in both offline and online settings, and (2) Leveraging data science techniques to model and predict psychological outcomes based on digital media usage and daily behavioral data. My research bridges my training in computer science and the field of communication to answer substantive research questions about social behavior, media and AI effect, and well-being in daily life. 
In conducting my research, I employ a broad range of interdisciplinary methods in computational social science, including machine learning, data mining, large language models (LLMs), network science, and AI-driven techniques. Additionally, I use statistical and causal inference, smartphone sensing, experience sampling, and multilevel modeling to analyze data and uncover patterns that offer insights into the complex interplay between human behavior, technology, and psychological outcomes.
